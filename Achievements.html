      <p>
        I am very good in sports and academics. I have achieved many awards in
        different fields. Here are some of my achievements. I have got Silver, Gold and Bronze medals
        in Running events at School Sports Day. I have played other sports like Football and
        Basketball at my school but due to injury I couldn't participate in more events.
        But the events I participated in, I gave my best and made our team proud and won trophies.
